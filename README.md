# Factor.io Connector
The Factor.io Connector is a [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) server for hosting integrations with 3rd party services. It provides a single interface for the runtime to all the integrated services. When you run the [Factor.io Server](https://github.com/factor-io/factor) (`factor s`) it uses WebSockets to connect to this Connector.

## Integrations
There is no code in this server for defining the third party services. Each of the integrations like [Github](https://github.com/factor-io/connector-github), [Heroku](https://github.com/factor-io/connector-heroku), [Rackspace](https://github.com/factor-io/connector-rackspace), [Hipchat](https://github.com/factor-io/connector-hipchat) are defined in separate gems, and they use the [factor-connector-api gem](https://github.com/factor-io/connector-api)  as a common library to define those integrations.

### Load a new integration
1. Add the gem containing the integration to the [Gemfile](https://github.com/factor-io/connector/blob/master/Gemfile).
2. Add the appropriate `require` statement in [init.rb](https://github.com/factor-io/connector/blob/master/init.rb).
